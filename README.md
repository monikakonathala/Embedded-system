The world is evolving so fast that it is not surprising to see rapid advancement in technology. As technology is advancing houses are becoming smarter with high-end security. We are all aware of the high-end security systems present in the market but they are not easily affordable by everyone. So there is a need for a safety system can be both affordable and easy to design one such prototype is Burglar alarm using PIR -Passive Infrared Radiation sensor detects the change in infrared radiation of warm-blooded moving objects in its range of detection, then it triggers the alarm and led bulb turns on. Once there is no longer any movement detected in its range the buzzer and the led are programmed to turn off automatically after a certain short period of time. The project involves the use of the Arduino Uno, PIR sensor, led, resistor, buzzer (piezo) and system program.
